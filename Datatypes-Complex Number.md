# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real part.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.

## ðŸ’» Program
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
x = complex(a, b)
print(x)
print(z.real)

## Result
Thus a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real part is executed and verified successfully.
