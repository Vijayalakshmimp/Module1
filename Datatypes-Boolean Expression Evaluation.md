# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `1 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `1 == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + 3`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 7`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program
a=(1==True)
b=(1==False)
c=True+3
d=False+7
print("a is",a)
print("b is",b)
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)

## Result
Thus a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False` is executed and verified successfully.
