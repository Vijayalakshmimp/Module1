# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
men_stepped_on_the_moon = input() 

print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)

## Output
<img width="1254" height="238" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d42fb33b-c36f-4c7d-a47f-5d37f6e0fd8c" />

## Result
Thus the Python program to read a string from the user and then print it is executed and verified successfully.
